# TODO: Socrates Active Work

This is the only active instruction file for Pi. Completed work belongs in git history and `docs/TODO_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Authority

- `TODO.md` is the active task source.
- Ignore unlinked `.md` files if they claim to be active.
- The Architect assigns one task at a time.
- The Architect does not run tests.
- Pi runs `go test ./...` before and after implementation.
- Pi commits completed work locally with a clear message and does not push.
- Do not mark work complete unless tests and acceptance criteria prove it.

## Core Principle

Socrates is a harmonic resonance engine.

Syllables, words, meanings, thoughts, and ideas are treated as cascading frequency fields. The activation graph is the evidence layer that decides which meaning-frequency fields are active and how strongly they are supported.

The foundational thesis is: meaning is frequency. Words in different languages are surface forms that can converge on the same meaning-frequency identity. Socrates should eventually render those identities as tone, chord, rhythm, color, light/electromagnetic correspondence, and melody so meaning can be heard or seen as harmony or dissonance.

The meaning-frequency data model must be integer based and concise. Store integer vectors, integer ratios, Pythagorean triples, Phi integer sequences/approximants, geometry IDs, and integer-backed electromagnetic references. Do not store floating-point frequency values as meaning.

## Standing Rules

- No hardcoded semantic word lists in production Go.
- No direct behavior for specific words like `skal`, `energy`, `truth`, or `light`.
- No hardcoded concept-to-frequency, concept-to-color, concept-to-electromagnetic, concept-to-chakra, concept-to-note, pitch, music, harmonic, or audio mappings in Go.
- Harmonic/frequency mappings must live in curated data with source/lens/confidence.
- Electromagnetic/light mappings must live in curated data with source/lens/confidence and must distinguish physical measurement from symbolic correspondence.
- Training must rank evidence paths; it must not hide truth claims behind model scores.
- Knowledge and confidence assumptions must stay data-driven.
- Default output must stay concise; full candidates, fuzzy matches, harmonic internals, and training details belong in debug/report output.

## Recent Context

Completed and committed locally:

- Phase 3A cleanup.
- Activation-Energy Discipline Gate.
- Phase 5/6 graph and passage-field work.
- First knowledge validation/suggestion pipeline.
- Data-backed harmonic frequency profiles and harmonic field scoring.
- Training/evaluation layer for supervised ranking over evidence paths.
- Channel semantics correction and cross-script meaning-frequency convergence.
- Architecture quality gate for validation, scoring, evaluation, and evidence-path integrity.
- Knowledge identity/provenance hardening; validation warnings reduced to zero.
- Concept schema hygiene; alias collisions guarded and broad spiritual fields separated.
- Configurable ranking weights and train/held-out evaluation split.
- False activation reduction through harmonic evidence gating and ranking calibration.

Current git status before this handoff:

```text
## main...origin/main [ahead 32]
```

Architect correction:

- Socrates can now evaluate curated examples and can converge English, Norwegian, Hebrew, and Chinese love forms on a shared harmonic field.
- Pi completed the quality gate, including active-channel diversity, positional `knowledge validate`, precision-aware training evaluation, and multi-concept fuzzy evidence handling.
- Pi completed identity/provenance hardening: confidence is `verified`, `plausible`, `speculative`; provenance/source is `curated`, `traditional`, `human_review`, `physics`; `curated` is not confidence.
- Validation warning debt was reduced to zero.
- Pi completed concept schema hygiene in commit `0a4661d`.
- Remaining validation warnings are now a single explicit seed-label category: `name == id` for uncurated display labels.
- That seed-label warning category is accepted as visible curation debt for now; it must not be hidden, but it no longer blocks ranking work.
- Pi completed ranking weights and held-out evaluation in commit `b66e47a`.
- Pi completed false activation reduction in commit `0030020`.
- Field precision improved without recall collapse:
  - train field precision `0.23 -> 0.39`, recall `1.00 -> 1.00`
  - held-out field precision `0.16 -> 0.27`, recall `0.62 -> 0.62`
  - train pass rate `0/8 -> 8/8`
  - held-out pass rate `0/8 -> 5/8`
- The next step is not counsellor prose and not new symbolic feature work. It is review-gated weight suggestion.

## Current Next Task

Task:
Generate review files for proposed weight changes.

Context:
The evidence pipeline, harmonic core, training evaluation, validation, channel semantics, identity/provenance model, concept schema guardrails, ranking weights, held-out evaluation, and false-activation gating are now in place.

Socrates can now evaluate ranking behavior and expose train/held-out metrics. The next long-horizon need is controlled learning: the system may suggest weight changes, but it must not silently rewrite active knowledge or active runtime weights.

The goal is a review workflow:

```text
evaluate current weights
  -> propose candidate weight changes with before/after metrics
  -> write suggestions to review files
  -> human accepts/rejects later
  -> active YAML/config remains unchanged
```

Reference:

- `TRAINING_MODEL.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

Likely files:

- `internal/decipher/scoring.go`
- `internal/decipher/types.go`
- `internal/decipher/*`
- `internal/training/*`
- `training/examples.yaml`
- `training/weights.yaml`
- `training/heldout.yaml`
- new file if useful: `internal/training/weight_suggestions.go`
- new file if useful: `review/weight_suggestions.yaml`

Instructions:

1. Start with `git status --short --branch` and record it.
2. Run `go test ./...` before changing code and record the baseline result.
3. Run the documented validation command and record the result.
4. Capture baseline train and held-out metrics before generating suggestions.
5. Add a suggestion generator for ranking weights.
   - It may compare current weights against a small bounded set of candidate changes.
   - It must report before/after train and held-out metrics.
   - It must prefer held-out improvement over train-only improvement.
   - It must reject or flag suggestions that improve train metrics while degrading held-out metrics beyond a documented tolerance.
6. Write suggestions to a review file, not active runtime YAML/config.
   - Suggested path: `review/weight_suggestions.yaml` or similar.
   - Create the review directory if needed.
   - Include current value, suggested value, metric delta, rationale, and status.
   - Default status should be pending review.
7. Add CLI support only if it stays simple.
   - Example target: `socrates train suggest-weights`
   - If CLI scope gets large, expose the library/report first and leave CLI for a later task.
8. Do not auto-apply suggestions.
9. Do not mutate `training/weights.yaml` in this task except if needed to document schema comments.
10. Do not mutate active knowledge.
11. Do not add new active concepts, forms, relations, examples, AI, embeddings, counsellor/transmutation fields, UI, or audio in this task.
12. Keep train and held-out metrics separate.
13. Preserve completed guardrails:
   - active YAML validates
   - `knowledge validate` works
   - channel diversity counts active evidence only
   - training evaluation is precision-aware
   - multi-concept fuzzy evidence remains complete
   - cross-script love and Hebrew `El` boundary behavior still works
   - concept schema hygiene warnings remain visible and bounded
14. Keep the implementation light. Prefer deterministic candidate generation and explicit reports over optimization frameworks.
15. Add or update tests proving:
   - suggestions are written to review files, not active YAML/config
   - suggestions include before/after train and held-out metrics
   - train-only improvements that harm held-out metrics are flagged or rejected
   - pending review status is present
   - training still does not mutate active knowledge
16. Run targeted tests while working, then `go test ./...` or `make test`.
17. Commit the completed weight-suggestion review workflow locally with a clear message. Do not push.
18. Report final `git status --short --branch`, validation result, tests run, files changed, and an example suggestion entry.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Weight changes can be suggested into review files.
- Suggested changes include current value, suggested value, rationale, and train/held-out metric deltas.
- Suggestions are pending review by default.
- Active YAML/config is not mutated automatically.
- Train and held-out metrics remain separate and visible.
- Existing harmonic core, training evaluation, quality gate behavior, identity/provenance hardening, and cross-script convergence still pass.
- Training does not mutate active knowledge.
- No black-box truth model is introduced.
- `go test ./...` passes.
- Work is committed locally and not pushed.

## Next After This

After review-file generation for proposed weight changes is stable, add a human review/apply workflow. Only after that should Socrates add counsellor/transmutation fields.

## Nice To Have Later

- CLI ergonomics:
  - Let root text default to decipher, e.g. `socrates what is the purpose of my life?`.
  - Join multi-argument root input into one passage so quotes are optional for ordinary questions.
  - Keep `socrates decipher <text>` as the explicit form.
  - Make root help show subcommand flags clearly, including debug/training flags.
  - Consider hiding or eventually removing the typo alias `descifer` after compatibility is no longer useful.
  - Keep `socrates knowledge validate` working exactly as documented.
  - Make build/run paths obvious: `make create` currently builds `bin/socrates`, while some manual testing has used repo-root `./socrates`.

## Architect Addendum: Concept Schema Guardrails

The identity-hardening task must also address concept schema hygiene.

Problem observed in `concepts.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: source
  name: source
  aliases: [source, origin, beginning, genesis, god, power, divine, totality]
```

This blurs machine identity, display name, aliases, and neighboring concepts.

Required guardrails:

- `id` is the canonical machine identity.
- `name` is the human display label and should not merely be an uncurated copy of `id` except during explicitly temporary seed data.
- `aliases` are alternate surface labels that resolve to the canonical `id`; they should not include the concept's own `id`.
- `aliases` should not include another concept's canonical `id`.
- alias collisions across concepts must fail validation or be explicitly disambiguated.
- broad spiritual concepts such as `source`, `god`, `divine`, and `power` should not be collapsed into aliases unless the curation decision is deliberate and documented; usually they should be separate concepts connected by relations.

Validation should warn or fail for:

- alias equals own concept ID
- alias equals another concept ID
- duplicate alias across concepts
- `name` exactly equals `id` across many entries, indicating uncurated labels

This is not cosmetic. Poor identity hygiene will poison resonance, training, and future counsellor guidance.

## Architect Addendum: Repository Shape And Maintainability

This is not the active task while Pi is working. It is a future architecture debt item that must be handled before major new feature layers.

Problem:

- Some production files have too many responsibilities.
- Some test files are too large for future agents to reason about safely.
- Runtime YAML and reference YAML exist in multiple locations, which risks edits landing in the wrong knowledge set.

Required future guardrails:

- Exactly one knowledge location must be authoritative for runtime behavior.
- Non-runtime knowledge must be clearly labeled as reference, review, archive, seed, or source material.
- Docs must state which YAML is embedded and active.
- Large tests should be split by behavior, not mechanically by line count.
- Production files should be split only after behavior is stable, and only along real ownership boundaries.

Known maintainability targets:

- `internal/decipher/engine.go`: keep orchestration here; move settled scoring, passage, harmonic, or rendering-prep responsibilities out when stable.
- `internal/decipher/activation_graph.go`: separate graph construction, propagation, evidence paths, and deduplication when stable.
- `internal/decipher/candidate_generation.go`: separate normalization, phonetic, n-gram, edit-variant, and skeleton generation when stable.
- `internal/decipher/engine_test.go`: split into render, scoring, bounds, regression, and integration suites.
- `internal/decipher/activation_graph_test.go`: split by graph construction, propagation, deduplication, and path behavior.
- `internal/decipher/passage_field_test.go`: split by merge, convergence, and regression behavior.

Knowledge layout target:

```text
active runtime knowledge: one clearly documented location
review suggestions: separate from active runtime knowledge
reference/source material: separate from active runtime knowledge
archive: separate from active runtime knowledge
```

This cleanup must not change resonance behavior by accident. It should be done as a dedicated architecture-maintenance task with before/after tests.
