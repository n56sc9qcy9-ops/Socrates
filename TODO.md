# TODO: Socrates Active Work

This is the only active instruction file for Pi. Completed work belongs in git history and `docs/TODO_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Authority

- `TODO.md` is the active task source.
- Ignore unlinked `.md` files if they claim to be active.
- The Architect assigns one task at a time.
- The Architect does not run tests.
- Pi runs `go test ./...` before and after implementation.
- Pi commits completed work locally with a clear message and does not push.
- Do not mark work complete unless tests and acceptance criteria prove it.

## Core Principle

Socrates is a harmonic resonance engine.

Syllables, words, meanings, thoughts, and ideas are treated as cascading frequency fields. The activation graph is the evidence layer that decides which meaning-frequency fields are active and how strongly they are supported.

The foundational thesis is: meaning is frequency. Words in different languages are surface forms that can converge on the same meaning-frequency identity. Socrates should eventually render those identities as tone, chord, rhythm, color, light/electromagnetic correspondence, and melody so meaning can be heard or seen as harmony or dissonance.

The meaning-frequency data model must be integer based and concise. Store integer vectors, integer ratios, Pythagorean triples, Phi integer sequences/approximants, geometry IDs, and integer-backed electromagnetic references. Do not store floating-point frequency values as meaning.

## Standing Rules

- No hardcoded semantic word lists in production Go.
- No direct behavior for specific words like `skal`, `energy`, `truth`, or `light`.
- No hardcoded concept-to-frequency, concept-to-color, concept-to-electromagnetic, concept-to-chakra, concept-to-note, pitch, music, harmonic, or audio mappings in Go.
- Harmonic/frequency mappings must live in curated data with source/lens/confidence.
- Electromagnetic/light mappings must live in curated data with source/lens/confidence and must distinguish physical measurement from symbolic correspondence.
- Training must rank evidence paths; it must not hide truth claims behind model scores.
- Knowledge and confidence assumptions must stay data-driven.
- Default output must stay concise; full candidates, fuzzy matches, harmonic internals, and training details belong in debug/report output.

## Recent Context

Completed (see `docs/TODO_ARCHIVE.md` and git history for detail):
- Phase 3A cleanup, activation-energy discipline gate, graph and passage-field work.
- Knowledge validation/suggestion pipeline, harmonic field scoring, training/eval layer.
- Channel semantics correction, cross-script convergence, quality gate.
- Identity/provenance hardening, concept schema hygiene, ranking weights, train/held-out split.
- False activation reduction, review-file generation, human review/apply workflow.
- Knowledge layout consolidation, oversized test split, production responsibility audit.
- CLI ergonomics cleanup, architecture readiness review, documentation consolidation.
- All acceptance criteria green. Readiness report at `docs/ARCHITECTURE_READINESS.md`.

Current git status:

```text
## main...origin/main [ahead 45]
```

Key completed metrics (full detail in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_READINESS.md`):
- Train field precision `0.39`, recall `1.00`, pass rate `8/8`.
- Held-out field precision `0.27`, recall `0.62`, pass rate `5/8`.
- Validation: 0 errors, 86 warnings (seed labels only).
- Cross-script convergence: English, Norwegian, Hebrew, Chinese love on shared harmonic field.
- Active channel diversity, precision-aware training, multi-concept fuzzy evidence: all verified.
- Confidence is `verified`/`plausible`/`speculative`; provenance is `curated`/`traditional`/`human_review`/`physics`; `curated` is not confidence.
- Active runtime knowledge is `internal/knowledge/`; reference material is `knowledge/reference/`.
- Full architecture readiness report at `docs/ARCHITECTURE_READINESS.md`.

## Current Next Task

Task:
Counsellor/transmutation fields.

Context:
Architecture readiness is complete. The engine is stable, documented, and ready for the next layer.

Counsellor/transmutation fields extend evidence-first reading with symbolic guidance capabilities, without adding hardcoded semantic behavior in Go.

Rules:
- No hardcoded word-specific behaviour in Go
- All mappings must be data-driven with source/lens/confidence
- Training must not mutate active knowledge
- No black-box truth model

Reference: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_READINESS.md`, `docs/KNOWLEDGE_CURATION.md`

## Next After This

After counsellor/transmutation fields:
- Integer-only harmonic data model coverage
- Extended script support (Arabic, Thai, etc.)
- Harmonic/audio rendering layer
- Consult `docs/ARCHITECTURE_READINESS.md` before major new feature layers

## Nice To Have Later

- counsellor/transmutation fields (current task)
- integer-only harmonic data model coverage
- extended script support (Arabic, Thai, etc.)
- harmonic/audio rendering layer
